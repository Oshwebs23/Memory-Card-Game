// GameBoard.jsx
// Purpose: Acts as the referee of the Memory Card Game.
// - Renders the grid of Card components.
// - Tracks two choosen cards (firstChoice, secondChoice).
// - Compares them to check for matches.
// - Calls back to App.jsx to update score and matched state
// - Resets choices after each turn.
// - In Short: GameBoard manages game flow, while Card.jsx handles individual card flip logic.
